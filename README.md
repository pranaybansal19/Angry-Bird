# Angry Bird

Angry Birds is a popular puzzle video game. In every level, the player uses a slingshot to launch the birds at the pigs
that are standing on buildings made of blocks. When a bird is launched, it can hit the buildings and make the blocks break. This can make the
pigs fall and disappear. The bird can also hit the pig itself to destroy it. The player has to destroy all the pigs in the
level to unlock another level.
